# 🕶️ HacDefCon: The Hidden Protocol

While the world watches DEF CON unfold under the neon sky of Las Vegas, another mission begins — silent, encrypted, and unseen by the untrained eye.

Somewhere between the chaos of hackers, the roar of slot machines, and the rhythm of flashing lights, a parallel game is being deployed. This isn't part of any official schedule, and you won't find it on the DEF CON badge. This is **HacDefCon** — an underground cyber-challenge designed to test your instincts, wit, and curiosity.

## The Challenge

Each day, from Wednesday to Saturday, a new digital trail will appear online. These aren't ordinary puzzles — they are fragments of a larger cyberattack simulation, each one inspired by modules from the **Certified Crimeware Defender** syllabus.

To survive, you'll need to:
- Decode
- Investigate
- Track threats in the real world

Each clue will lead you to a physical location in Las Vegas — places where traces of a fictional breach were last detected. And as you follow the trail, you'll get closer to a final objective.

> This isn't a race. It's a test of perseverance and precision.  
> Only those who complete every mission and prove they were truly present in the hunt will qualify.

## The Reward

A chance to win a **full scholarship** to our Certified Crimeware Defender certification, valued at **$3,000 USD** — completely free.

## The Question Is:

**Can you hunt like a defender, and think like an attacker?**
